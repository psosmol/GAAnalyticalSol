# GAAnalyticalSol
Genetic Algorithm for Analytical Solutions to Differential Equations

The target of this project is to make a software in C++,  that solve a differential equation using genetic algorithms.
It is not necesary begin from scratch, we can use the program developed by ryanlacroix:
https://github.com/ryanlacroix/genetic-algorithm-all-ones
for example and modify it in a way that a Chromosome be a mathematical expression, more explicitly a binary expression tree:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree
Then we will use the project Ginac https://www.ginac.de/  for the calculus of fitness of the posible solutions. 

We hope you join us soon!
